# Autonomous-Cars-on-IDD Detectron2
## ðŸŒŸ Overview
The "Autonomous-Cars-on-IDD Detectron2" project, which focuses on training an instance segmentation model using the IDD (Indian Driving Dataset)
dataset. The goal of this project is to enable autonomous cars to accurately detect and classify objects in real-world driving scenarios.

By utilizing the IDD dataset, which contains a diverse collection of images captured from various driving perspectives, we trained a state-of-the-art instant
segmentation model based on Detectron2. This model leverages advanced computer vision techniques to precisely segment and classify different objects, such as
vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and road markings, in the driving environment.

The trained model offers real-time performance and high accuracy, allowing autonomous cars to make informed decisions based on the detected objects. This contributes
to enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems by enabling them to understand their surroundings and respond appropriately to different
traffic scenarios.

Our project not only demonstrates the effectiveness of instant segmentation using the IDD dataset but also lays the foundation for further research and development
in the field of autonomous driving. We are excited about the potential impact this technology can have on improving road safety and transforming the future of
transportation.
